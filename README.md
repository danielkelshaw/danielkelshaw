Hello! I am currently a PhD student [@ImperialCollege](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/). My research lies at the intersection of machine learning, physics, and differential geometry. The goal of this research is to leverage reduced-order models for high-dimensional, complex physical phenomena - utilising tools from differential geometry and physics to operate directly on low-dimensional manifolds.

Previously, I worked as a machine learning research intern [@NasaJPL](https://github.com/nasa-jpl), [@ESA](https://github.com/esa), [@MindFoundry](https://github.com/MindFoundry), [@Dyson](https://github.com/dysonltd), and [@BAESystems](https://www.baesystems.com/en/home).
